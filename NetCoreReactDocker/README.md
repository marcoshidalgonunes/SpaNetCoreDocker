# NetCoreReactDocker
.NET Core App with React and containerized using Docker.

The dockerfile created when Docker support was added to the project contains changes to initialize the React environment inside container. It fixes the example shown in [Quickstart: Use Docker with a React Single-page App in Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/containers/container-tools-react?view=vs-2019#modify-the-dockerfile-linux-containers).
